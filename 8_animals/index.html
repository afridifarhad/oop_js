      Write a JavaScript program that creates a class called 'Animal' with
      properties for species and sound. Include a method to make the animal's
      sound. Create a subclass called 'Dog' that inherits from the 'Animal'
      class and adds an additional property for color. Override the make sound
      method to include the dog's color. Create an instance of the 'Dog' class
      and make it make its sound.
