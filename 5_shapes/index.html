      Write a JavaScript program that creates a class called 'Shape' with a
      method to calculate the area. Create two subclasses, 'Circle' and
      'Triangle', that inherit from the 'Shape' class and override the area
      calculation method. Create an instance of the 'Circle' class and calculate
      its area. Similarly, do the same for the 'Triangle' class.
