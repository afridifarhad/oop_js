  <h2> Write a JavaScript program that creates a class called 'Employee' with 
    properties for name and salary. Include a method to calculate annual salary. 
    Create a subclass called 'Manager' that inherits from the 'Employee' class and 
    adds an additional property for department. Override the annual salary 
    calculation method to include bonuses for managers. Create two instances of the 
    'Manager' class and calculate their annual salary. </h2>
