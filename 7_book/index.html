      Write a JavaScript program that creates a class `Book` with properties for
      title, author, and publication year. Include a method to display book
      details. Create a subclass called 'Ebook' that inherits from the 'Book'
      class and includes an additional property for book price. Override the
      display method to include the book price. Create an instance of the
      'Ebook' class and display its details.
