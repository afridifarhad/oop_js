      Write a JavaScript program that creates a class called Product with
      properties for product ID, name, and price. Include a method to calculate
      the total price by multiplying the price by the quantity. Create a
      subclass called PersonalCareProduct that inherits from the Product class
      and adds an additional property for the warranty period. Override the
      total price calculation method to include the warranty period. Create an
      instance of the PersonalCareProduct class and calculate its total price.
