      Write a JavaScript program that creates a class called 'Vehicle' with
      properties for make, model, and year. Include a method to display vehicle
      details. Create a subclass called 'Car' that inherits from the 'Vehicle'
      class and includes an additional property for the number of doors.
      Override the display method to include the number of doors.
